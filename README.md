# Natural_Language_Processing_Coursera

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language. 

This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text. These and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper. 


## NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces

Module 1: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
+ Learn to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using a logistic regression.

Module 2: Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes
+ Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier.

Module 3: Vector Space Models
+ Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. You'll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.

Module 4: Machine Translation and Document Search
+ Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.


## NLP with Probabilistic Models

Module 1: Autocorrect
+ Learn about autocorrect, minimum edit distance, and dynamic programming, then build a spellchecker to correct misspelled words.

Module 2: Part of Speech Tagging and Hidden Markov Models
+ Learn about Markov chains and Hidden Markov models, then use them to create part-of-speech tags for a Wall Street Journal text corpus.

Module 3: Autocomplete and Language Models
+ Learn about how N-gram language models work by calculating sequence probabilities, then build an autocomplete language model using a text corpus from Twitter.

Module 4: Word Embeddings with Neural Networks
+ Learn about how word embeddings carry the semantic meaning of words, which makes them much more powerful for NLP tasks, then build a Continuous bag-of-words model to create word embeddings from Shakespeare text.


## NLP with Sequence Models

Module 1: Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling
+ Learn about the limitations of traditional language models and see how RNNs and GRUs use sequential data for text prediction. Then build the next-word generator using a simple RNN on Shakespeare text data.

Module 2: LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition
+ Learn about how long short-term memory units (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient problem, and how Named Entity Recognition systems quickly extract important information from text. Then build a Named Entity Recognition system using an LSTM and data from Kaggle.

Module 3: Siamese Networks
+ Learn about Siamese networks, a special type of neural network made of two identical networks that are eventually merged together, then build a Siamese network that identifies question duplicates in a dataset from Quora.

## NLP with Attention Models

Module 1: Neural Machine Translation
+ Discover some of the shortcomings of a traditional seq2seq model and how to solve for them by adding an attention mechanism, then build a Neural Machine Translation model with Attention.

Module 2: Text Summarization
+ Compare RNNs and other sequential models to the more modern Transformer architecture, then create a tool that generates text summaries.

Module 3: Question Answering
+ Explore transfer learning with state-of-the-art models like T5 and BERT, then build a model that can answer questions.
